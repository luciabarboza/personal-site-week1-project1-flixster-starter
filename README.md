### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe the labs did prepare me to complete the assignment. They slowly progressed and allowed me to apply the knowledge before completing the project. 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have created an overview which provided the details of the movie. I also would have styled the buttons more. 

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Everything went well, I think something that I could improve is my explanations of the project in my demo. 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
